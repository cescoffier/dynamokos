This page shows the different architectures of the dynamokos application accross the blog posts.


= Post 1 =
[http://dynamokos.googlecode.com/svn/resources/architecture-p1.png]

The first post just relies on Distributed Services (Apache CXF Distributed OSGi). the oracle is exported using SOAP (Web Service).The client *knows* the oracle location, and use it (also using DOSGi). 

However, this does not handle the dynamism and does not check the accessibility of the oracle. So, if you don't start the oracle, the client will still be ok, the {{{Prediction}}} service will still be provided! The only issue is that the web client will not work correctly as the service in NOT there.
