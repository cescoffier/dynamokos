To run the demo of the post 1, execute in a first console:
{{{
java -Dfelix.config.properties=file:./conf/oracle-dosgi.properties -jar bin/felix.jar cache/oracle-dosgi
}}}

This launches the Oracle OSGi platform.

Then launch in a second console:
{{{
java -Dfelix.config.properties=file:./conf/client-dosgi.properties -jar bin/felix.jar cache/client-dosgi
}}}

This launches the client and the web-part.

Once done, open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/dynamokos/index.html].

That's it !
