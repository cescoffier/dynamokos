The build process is based on Maven.

== Building the sources ==

To compile, just follows the instruction:
  # Get the sources (from SVN or from the downloads section)
  # If needed unzip the downloaded archive
  # Execute {{{mvn clean install}}} from the root of the downloaded sources.

That's it !

== Creating the distribution files ==

The creation of distribution is also based on Maven. From the parent pom (root), run:
{{{
mvn clean install assembly:assembly
}}}

Files will be created in the {{{target}}} folder.
